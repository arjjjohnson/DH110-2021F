DH110: User Experience and Design
UX Wireframe/Paper_protoype

## Overview
### Description

From the field research gathered it seems that the solution is simple, first off, we know that families aren’t happy with how they access care, we know that practitioners are looking for a way to integrate technology to ultimately ease some of their workloads, therefore, like i mentioned, the answer seems easy, create an application that expedites this process and allows families, individuals, practitioners the freedom to do it on their own time and focusing on their own needs. 

To my surprise, as well as yours now, it hasn’t been done yet. Therefore, the solution is to create a tool that ties together these three essential elements together 
- 1. The ability to access support to determine whether your child needs more comprehensive evaluation 
- 2. The ability to connect with provider DIRECTLY in your are (using geolocation)
- 3. The ability to communicate with these providers without having to set up numerous consultations and therefore, being effective and efficient support straight to your mobile device. 
- 4. The ability to create a network of social network of support with others nearby


### Purpose
To demonstrate the purpose of this proposed lo-fi prototype, I've created a storyboard from users facing these choices.

Revisiting Sarah & John's Personas
> Sarah: When Evan was born, Sarah took a leave from her job as a registered nurse. She was anticipating going back when he turned 1-years-old but then her husband received a raise at work and with the high cost of childcare, it started to make more sense for her to stay home. Since she is stay-at-home mom she already wonders if Evan is missing out on potential socializability interactions but doesn't think much of it. She does however, start to notice some developmental markers he's not hitting and enters the Arizona Government webpage. She is instantly overwhelmed and thinks "Why isn't there a way to quickly connect with families around me who might be having these questions." After school she meets a new family who shows her a webppage that uses geolocation to connect families with one another. There are various levels of support integrated so she feels confident she's discussing with someone who is prioritizing her needs. Sarah feels fairly skilled in technology but as she tries to navigate the Arizona.gov homepage she quickly loses confidence. With this newly proposed design Sarah is able to see families nearby who have asked the same questions and is able to view the community forum page to see how others went about solving this problem in her neighborhood, within the same school districts. She is joyful because for the first time she knows she can lean on her community during this difficult time.

Sarah is able to use her zipcode to find various levels of social support. She is able to select that she wants to talk to a parent's group and is shown which support groups meet on which days and times. Additionally, Sarah is able to ask for a social coach who is someone in the field with experience who can guide her with the next steps. She is able to chat with them directly through the app as well as write in her calendar which times the parents are meeting. Sarah is feeling at ease knowing she doesn't have to do this all by herself. 

**Based off of Sarah's persona,** I wanted to incorporate a way for individuals to directly communicate with providers, other parents, or social coaches to share thoughts and even questions. Along with a component that allows users to communicate with other users as a place for support (which is backed by so much literature and supporting research). If we could eventually figure out a way to incentivize users to talk to one another and eventually get to a place where we have users able to answer questions of other users, almost a peer coach in a way. We know a lot of success in this world comes from social resources - so if we could make that come to fruition this would create more incentive to continue using the application, etc. 

> John: John is having questions about his child's development. At a recent family barbeque, his sister asked him if he's concerned with his son's language development. With his sister being a pediatrician, he feels that she may be overanalyzing his son and snaps back. However, he can't help feeling a bit unsettled as he leaves the barbeque. He logs into Arizona's government page as his first step plan but instantly gets frustrated as there are hardly any resources available and they are not clearly marked. He doesn't exactly know what he's looking for, but he knows its not what is in front of him. He needs a clear way to search for his questions and be connected to practioners in the area that can clearly answer them. He is recommended an application that breaks down these questions using geolocation - this shows him what services are offered at various levels (individual, group, mentorship, support). As product manager, John feels comfortable with techonology and typically experiences zero issues when it comes to finding an answer. 

John is able to search the providers in the area - the list of providers showed up by proximity and ratings. He can see mutliple providers, with their ratings and distance to his zipcode. He is able to input his needs to make the search more personalized to him. Additionally, he is able to select his availability and receive a curated list based on his needs, availability, and wants. John feels curious if he can find the top rated providers. He clicks on the sort by rating button on the right top and now check the providers according to the high-ratings of reviews, as well as their distance and availability. He feels relieved he doesn't have to wait months for answers. 

**Based off of John's needs**, I wanted to create a function of the application that serves to determine whether your child needs a more comprehensive assessment or what level of services may be appropriate. One of the essential parts of this application is using Geolocation to help individuals search for providers by location and get connected 


The Main Goals are to:
- Matches symptomology with providers with various specialty areas
- Prompts parents to enter data daily
- Shares information across contexts (doctors & schools)
- Gives push notifications when a provider sends a message
- Gives targeted advice to families based upon symptomatology


## Wireframes
I did my best to stick to the paper sketches but realized that I am be better fit to continue using webbased tools to facilitate this portion of development.

## Wireflows
+1: At least one sequence of the user interaction flow was presented with wireframes and arrow_lines 
+1: At least two tasks (from persona + usage scenario) were presented via wireflow
+1: Complete interaction sequences for all the possible choices and exit/cancel/back were clearly presented via wireflow

## Testing
For this assignment, I was able to have a 28 yo female, psuedonym: Rylee, support and walk through the lo-fi prototype. 

![Walk through 1 - Sarah](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91240122/139875202-723c3ea6-a315-4ff8-bd02-e015fcebda98.png)

These photos depict my user walking through the prototype, using a pen to depict the various wires. These images show the user using this before the flows were added to ensure the user was able to follow along with the written assignment. 

## Summary
+1: Summary of the process, what went smoothly or differently from your expectation

+1: What you would change or design differently based on the feedback you got from the prototype testing. 

+1 For each, describe in a sentence or two what problem the tester encountered, and in another sentence or two how you would address the problem if you were to revise the prototype.

This process was a unique experience. As mentioned above, the pen and paper technique proved to be much more difficult than I originally expected. However, my participant was able to follow my conceptual process and was able to see the design ideas. They were impressed with how much can exactually be extracted from a small wireframe task. 

Based on the feedback from the testing, I do see how valuable it is to include the exit possibility as well as making the tasks as simple as possible. From this activity, I've realized there are a few components I am missing and it'll be important to include those in the next phase of development.

### Wireframe & wireflow 1: John's Access to Services
Problem: Initially the user wasn't clear on what the boxes meant with the prompts. For example, was age asking for the age of their child or the age of the therapist. 
Solution: Making a clear distinction that this would either be a type out box or a drop down menu with various options. It would also be important to include additional wording to support. 
Problem: 
Solution: 


As such, I would definitely like to try my hand at digitizing this process in the future. Testing the prototype in its current form deemed to be a difficult task.
Conceptually, I understood what needed to happen, but I did not want to guide the user too much with additional arrows or images that were part of the wireflow but not the wireframe. I feel that the user did not pay too much attention to the “click” indications and arrows that I did have present in the wireframes, though, so that part of the testing process went properly. Overall, I feel that creating digitized wireframes / wireflows would have allowed me to create and test more scenarios, screens, and steps more easily and may have provided a smoother experience for the test user. However, I feel that the testing that did occur was still beneficial for me because it highlighted the importance of small details for the user in deciding what to choose as their next step.
