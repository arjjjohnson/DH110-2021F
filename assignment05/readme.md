DH110: User Experience and Design
UX Wireframe/Paper_protoype

## Overview
### Description
Brief summary of user-research, persona and the features you wrote as usage scenario; The purpose of this low-fidelity prototyping

From the background you just heard and our results we’ve presented throughout the last few weeks, it seems that the solution is simple, first off, we know that families aren’t happy with how they access care, we know that practitioners are looking for a way to integrate technology to ultimately ease some of their workloads, therefore, like i mentioned, the answer seems easy, create an application that expedites this process and allows families, individuals, practitioners the freedom to do it on their own time and focusing on their own needs. 

To our surprise, as well as yours now, it hasn’t been done yet. Therefore, the solution is to have an application that ties together these three essential elements together 1. The ability to access support to determine whether your child needs more comprehensive evaluation, 2. The ability to connect with provider DIRECTLY in your are (using geolocation) and 3. The ability to communicate with these providers without having to set up numerous consultations and therefore, being effective and efficient support straight to your mobile device. 


### Purpose
This is our prototype which outlines the essential functions of the application as well as what makes this application unique from our competitors. We have integrated the parents needs and wants, in naturalistic settings, you have the ability to capture events to share directly with providers, where they are happening. 
We mentioned that this application serves to determine whether your child needs a more comprehensive assessment or what level of services may be appropriate. 
One of the essential parts of our application is using Geolocation to help individuals search for providers by location and get connected 

And finally, we wanted to incorporate a way for individuals to directly communicate with providers, upload notes, thoughts and even questions. Along with a component that allows users to communicate with other users as a place for support (which is backed by so much literature and supporting research). If we could eventually figure out a way to incentivize users to talk to one another and eventually get to a place where we have users able to answer questions of other users, almost a peer coach in a way. We know a lot of success in this world comes from social resources - so if we could make that come to fruition this would create more incentive to continue using the application, etc. 

Matches symptomology with providers with various specialty areas
14. App that prompts parents to enter data daily
15. App that shares information across contexts (doctors & schools)
16. Gives push notifications when a provider sends a message
17. Gives targeted advice to families based upon symptomatology


## Wireframes
+1 At least three distinctive wireframes (= sketches of the screen) that represent the user flow (the input and output of the system) 
+1: Thoughtful content design including proper texts and button labels


## Wireflows
+1: At least one sequence of the user interaction flow was presented with wireframes and arrow_lines 
+1: At least two tasks (from persona + usage scenario) were presented via wireflow
+1: Complete interaction sequences for all the possible choices and exit/cancel/back were clearly presented via wireflow

## Testing
+1: Note the tester’s confusion or unexpected interaction; Note whether the tester could successfully complete the tasks 
+1: pictures/video of the tester’s walkthrough pathway


## Summary
+1: Summary of the process, what went smoothly or differently from your expectation

+1: What you would change or design differently based on the feedback you got from the prototype testing. 

+1 For each, describe in a sentence or two what problem the tester encountered, and in another sentence or two how you would address the problem if you were to revise the prototype.

Creating the low-fidelity prototype is what it seems most people imagine UX/UI design to be, so it was very interesting to finally reach this phase in the design process. I think the fact that I was simply creating new features for an existing application rather than completely ideating my own application did make this different from what I initially expected at the start of this class. I learned that preparing a low-fi prototype by hand is quite a repetitive process — while I was creating the wireframes, I was glad to be building off of the design of an existing application, but I also realized at a certain point that I may have been including too many details in the process. As such, I would definitely like to try my hand at digitizing this process in the future. Testing the prototype in a paper-and-pencil environment was also quite a unique experience. Conceptually, I understood what needed to happen, but I did not want to guide the user too much with additional arrows or images that were part of the wireflow but not the wireframe. I feel that the user did not pay too much attention to the “click” indications and arrows that I did have present in the wireframes, though, so that part of the testing process went properly. Overall, I feel that creating digitized wireframes / wireflows would have allowed me to create and test more scenarios, screens, and steps more easily and may have provided a smoother experience for the test user. However, I feel that the testing that did occur was still beneficial for me because it highlighted the importance of small details for the user in deciding what to choose as their next step.
