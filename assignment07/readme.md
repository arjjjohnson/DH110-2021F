# DH110: User Experience and Design | UX interactive_protoype


## Introduction

Now more than ever before, everyone is looking to connect with healthcare services. The purpose of this project is to support users in finding and accessing available resources in a clear and accessible manner for all users. This prototype aims to do just that. Furthermore, this interactive prototype demonstrates how a system can be bolstered to support users in connecting to the services, resources, and supports they may need. This prototype is an accumulation of user experiences and direct reports on needs. 

## Cognitive Walkthrough #1 
### (2 UX student researchers) 

This is the summarized results of the initial cognitive walkthrough. This is broken down into what is working, what could be improved, and what is not yet answered.

_In terms of what is working,_ the users in the cognitive walkthrough were able to describe what the purpose of the webpage is based on the design development. This was the main goal of this project. Additionally, users reported seamless engagement with the prototype and were able to navigate forward through the design and finally reporting that overall the project was well-developed. Lastly, the users reported positive experiences with the menu, dropdown menus as well as finding the available resources. 

_In terms of what could be improved upon,_ the users reported that the color scheme may be a bit difficult and clicking some of the hyperlinks. Furthermore, one user reported that some of the buttons for navigation may not be as intuitive. 

_In terms of what has not yet been answered,_ the users reported that navigating backwards was a difficult task as there isn’t an inherent way to navigate back to the previous page. 

Initial Prototype
![Initial Set-Up](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91240122/144138701-2ac3109d-2d5f-4e46-aea2-f9f0b5e7ddc4.png)

> From this initial cognitive walkthrough, two concerns were immediately addressed. First, the hyperlinks were underlined to show that they are still part of the webpage and would not take users outside of the website. Additionally, the colors were slightly modified to ensure that users are able to easily navigate without distracting colors. 

> The main functionality I chose to focus on was the menu and drop down pages -- after multiple rounds of user feedback etc. the issue that kept coming up was the navigation buttons and how to access the site from the page they were on. My users reported feeling that they were thrown into the webpage without understanding how they started or how to return to the homepage. Additionally, I chose to change the frame size to accommodate newer devices (from Iphone 8 which is what I have - to the newer iphone 13). While changing this frame, I decided to add the traditional apple navigational tools, while making the back button functional for users. 

Adjusting the wireflows to reflect the new navigation between frames.

## Important Changes 
The biggest change that was made was the start of a homepage with options for users to select who they are and what brings them to this specific webpage. The changes that followed included: 
- Created an easier to navigate homepage
- Adjusted text and colors
- Added features including a back button to replicate iphone users and navigate next steps and pages 
- Adjusted text to be less and easier to navigate 
- Deleted selected state of buttons and reoriented them 
- Made chat box more functional with more items to replicate a real design 
- Incorporating a chat function rather than an more confusing menu bar 

Initial Adjustments

Lastly, after going back to the initial stages of development, as typical in the iterative nature of these designs. I decided to enhance a few features, including the chatbox feature while making this functional.

Following these changes, I was able to conduct another cognitive walkthrough. This time with an individual more representative of my target audience. 

## Cognitive Walkthrough 2

> This cognitive walkthrough highlighted some very important considerations for moving forward. The part that stood out to me most was that the user initially thought the purpose of this design would be to allow users to make appointments directly with providers. This stood out to me because this would be something I would love to develop and pursue. I was immediately brought back to my initial survey of 51 users which highlighted the importance of having a tool that allows for directly communicating with and connecting with providers and practitioners. Furthermore, the user reported an overall positive experience with the prototype. Even reporting that, if something was this straightforward and easy to use, stating “I would feel much more confident about my health if I had a service like this.” 

The tasks for this prototype have been expanded to include the new features, as well as what the capabilities of this high fidelity prototype are. 

#### Task 1
- Find a support group in your community
You are a parent looking for support in your community 
- Purpose: Have the homepage to directly connect you with resources that apply to you instead of having to go through countless that do not pertain to your needs - and/or interests
- Capabilities: Navigate to the resource folder to find exactly what you need / want
- Other methods: Utilize the chat function to be connected with various resources

#### Task 2
- Make an appointment with provider
- Can be completed through the chat function or through the homepage drop down menus

#### Task 3
- You are a community clinician who is planning appointments for December and are curious what the current covid-19 requirements are for the schools. You want to utilize the chat function to get you there the quickest.

## Reflection

In the end, my prototpye isn't exactly where I'd love for it to be, but I am confident that my users are the center of this entire project. With that said, one important thing I learned with this project is that there is always more that you can edit and change, with the time limitations on assignments, I had to push myself to focus on select tasks rather than making a fully operational prototype. The iterative process showed me that you can make adjustments along the way but ultimately, the most important part of this process is checking in with your users.
