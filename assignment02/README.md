# DH110 Asssignment02 - Usability Testing

## Usability Evaluation of Arizona's Child & Teen Healthcare webpages.
For this usability pilot test, I recruited a 27 year old female to navigate through various tasks using the Arizona Child & Teen healthcare pages. Although this participant does not have children of her own yet, I knew she would be an ideal candidate for this pilot as she would have an above average knowledge of various websites. Futhermore, throughout our introductions I learned that this participant works within Human Resources and focuses on resource access and data analytics, therefore, deeming her to be considered more of an expert than an average user.

## Reflection
_What did you learned during the pilot test?_

During the pilot test, I learned that a part of UX is being empathetic with the users experience and with the users reactions. It was an interesting experience for me, as the research, watching the participants nonverbal communication. For example, I wonder if the experiment would have been better suited for the participant to record themselves rather than me watching them in real time. There are a few avenues of exploring 

_What went well and what went not so well?_

There were many things that went well during this pilot UT and many opportunities to learn and improve moving forward. One stand out good part of this pilot UT, was the dialougue that naturally came about between the researcher and participant. The user felt that they were unable to navigate the webpage then in real time came to the realization that it wasn't due to their navigation skills but rather due to the fact that the webpage was not supporting them in their tasks and goals. Some areas for improvement would be proofreading some of the designs, testing the functionality of my questionnaires and ensuring ease and lightening burden for the participant.

_How do you want to improve your UT in the future?_

In the future, I would practice each scenario myself a few times to find all potential routes and avenues to achieve the desired outcome. With future iterations of this project specifically I would devote more time to the instructions as well as a general overview of navigating the webpage (or at least provide some steps if the user is unable to find the original starting page). This task did prove to be rather difficult for the participant. Although, they reported a higher than average experience with webpages, this specific site did not offer any substantive support for the user.
