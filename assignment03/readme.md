## Introduction Steps 



✅ Step 1: Specify the main design challenge

>Background and Development
>At the initial stages of development, I was able to receive feedback from 51 parents and practitioners of individuals with Autism. Therefore, the purpose of this evaluation is to examine the methods that will best address the application idea that came to fruition from those initial conversations. 

Clarifying Objectives & Goals

Attrition and latency rates
Who completed the app but never found a provider
Who downloaded the app and never completed the questionnaires/video upload requirement
How long does it take for providers to respond to screening/diagnostic and treatment questions
How much time elapses from form completion and submission to diagnostic appointment?
User experience 
Do users find the app easy to use?
Do users find the app useful?
Are there hiccups in the app?

Segment:
Clients 
Providers 

Accuracy of app: Correct risk categorization 

Stakeholders
- As each type of stakeholder may have a different perspective, this evaluation hopes to appeal to their unique needs, while considering the idea development process as a whole the main consideration.
- Who are they?

During the initial analysis, seven primary themes emerged. These were broadly categorized as: informing and communicating with and to parents, supporting families, relationship building, treatment quality, accessibility of care, technical considerations, and lastly new opportunities. 

Regarding our first theme, clinicians emphasized the general difficulty in coordinating care and providing diagnostic and clinical updates to family members. One particularly interesting suggestion was through the use of behavior and progress trackers for sharing information. Next, parents and clinicians discussed the need for additional support for family members, ranging from psychoeducation and help navigating the healthcare ecosystem to emotional and peer support. 

We then examined relationship building. Therapeutic alliance not only between patient and clinician, but family and clinician is especially necessary for successful remote sessions. Many participants commented more directly on quality of services during the pandemic. It came as no surprise that there was marked skepticism of telehealth services as have been conducted over the past year. The ADOS, the gold-standard ASD diagnosis assessment, was described by many as impossible in this context. While less widespread, many contended that quality ASD treatment requires in-person visits, and that cannot change even as telehealth becomes more popular. 

Echoing research described earlier in this document, many participants discussed accessibility as a core concern, with telehealth exacerbating systemic inequity in mental healthcare. There is a need to closely consider availability of high speed wireless internet, computing devices, and even space as services evolve. Interestingly, one participant discussed how attendance rates have increased since the pandemic and their group’s advent of remote services. 

Crucially, many participants discussed specific technical concerns related to remote services and the pandemic. The webcam was a common source of frustration, with patients being difficult to follow or themselves exhibiting a lack of attention. Regarding the pandemic specifically, one clinician described the difficulty in reading facial cues when patients were wearing protective masks. Conversely, many participants discussed the opportunities brought on by the pandemic and greater adoption of telehealth. Participants indicated interest in using tech to better coordinate care for ASD with other providers, as an adjunct to traditional therapy methods, and enhance data collection, among others. 

Further coding of our qualitative data will include organizing challenges and recommendations by relevance during the pandemic, more generally, or both. However, as many of our clinician participants indicated their intent to continue remote services at varying levels after the pandemic. The market is rife with opportunities related to the expanded and continued use of technology in the field of autism (Dattro, 2021). 


## Interview transcript / observation notes


## Short Reflection

the assessment process is a uniquely formidable time for individuals on the autism spectrum and their families. Further, the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on children and families is vast even if the longitudinal effects of such a traumatic experience during pivotal developmental periods is not yet known. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues and society faces challenges like never before, bringing clinicians and families into the discussion around the impact of COVID-19 is pivotal. Despite these being unprecedented times, we must also look to those experiencing these issues first hand for better understanding around the probable short and long-term impacts of this pandemic on service and care in order to guide us in the creation of innovative and proactive solutions. Through the continued integration of diverse stakeholders perspectives (e.g., Autistics, parents, teachers, clinicians, and service providers), the need for additional support that improves the assessment process and service outcomes for individuals with ASD will come to fruition and help navigate this important milestone for autistic individuals.

Generally, we see an unprecedented landscape of opportunities for our product to make an impact in the Autism Spectrum Disorder Market. Digital health was already on the rise before the COVID-19 pandemic but has accelerated exponentially. Part of this has been a function of necessity. Virtually all routine services that could be conducted remotely were transitioned to this modality. However, it has become an area of growing preference as well, as patients and providers have benefited from the convenience of telemedicine and the novel capabilities of the broader telehealth modality. This trend has been clear throughout the wider healthcare ecosystem but also apparent in the ASD community: a significant contingent of both providers and caregivers from our recent survey indicated positive characterization of these services and a clear intention to continue using them even after the pandemic and related health and safety guidelines
