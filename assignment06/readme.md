DH110: User Experience and Design
UX interface Design

## Brief Description of Project

The purpose of this assignment was to gain an understanding of the accessing services and resources process through those with direct experience and how they believe that technology can be used to increase access to these. The findings from this initial analysis suggest that this process is a uniquely formidable time for individuals on autism and their families. Further, the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on children and families is vast even if the longitudinal effects of such a traumatic experience during pivotal developmental periods is not yet known. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues and society faces challenges like never before, bringing clinicians and families into the discussion around the impact of COVID-19 is pivotal. Despite these being unprecedented times, we must also look to those experiencing these issues first hand for better understanding around the probable short and long-term impacts of this pandemic on service and care in order to guide us in the creation of innovative and proactive solutions. Through the continued integration of diverse stakeholders perspectives (e.g., Autistics, parents, teachers, clinicians, and service providers), the need for additional support that improves the assessment process and service outcomes for individuals with autism will come to fruition and help navigate this important milestone for autistic individuals.

Generally, we see an unprecedented landscape of opportunities for technology to make an impact in the assessment, access to care, and digit resources. Digital health was already on the rise before the COVID-19 pandemic but has accelerated exponentially. Part of this has been a function of necessity. Virtually all routine services that could be conducted remotely were transitioned to this modality. However, it has become an area of growing preference as well, as patients and providers have benefited from the convenience of telemedicine and the novel capabilities of the broader telehealth modality. This trend has been clear throughout the wider healthcare ecosystem but also apparent in the ASD community: a significant contingent of both providers and caregivers from our recent survey indicated positive characterization of these services and a clear intention to continue using them even after the pandemic and related health and safety guidelines.

This provides a clear need for resources to be clear and accessible to all users.

4. Description of your decision making process about the final graphical interface design

> While ... I decided to make the graphic design minimal and uncluttered, providing necessary information as needed but otherwise keeping the interface clean of extraneous information. I designed the interface to be friendly, with rounded buttons, and to resemble the interface of other reading apps such as news paper websites to make the website recognizable as being related to reading.

## Impression Test

**28 yo male**

_Unfortunately, this user did not consent to having their photo / screensharing recording shared. However, they did approve for me to transcribe and share their impressions._

Positive Remarks
- "The colors seem to have coordination, I feel like red is pleasing to both men and women." 
- "Easy to read and follow along" 
- "Aesthetically pleasing website"
- "The arrows are helpful in order to follow along"

Neutral Remarks
- "Red is interesting choice, now that I think about it" 
- "Is it easy to get to this page? It doesn't seem like a homepage"

Ways to Improve
- "Are the extra search bars necessary? What do they search? Do you have to search or can you scroll and click?"
- "Why does it stop at 11 year olds?"

> Through this impression test,  I was really able to see how I could make this project my own moving forward. The user was overall very positive about the current iteration. He stated that it's interesting to choose red, since it is commonly more pleasing for men than women. He was stating how this could be important as he would imagine having to seek out resources or support as a father might be an intimidating task. This was a perspective I had not initially thought of as we know men are less likely to actively seek out resources or support unless it's imperative. 

## Accessibility (color-contrast) check

6. Evidence of accessibility (color-contrast at least) check

> I ensured that my color contrasts adhere to the WCAG2.0 AA level standard of accessibility, and decided on a non-white background to ensure that users with difficulty reading on a white background feel more comfortable using this site.

## Reflection 

Moving forward, it's imperative to continue collecting elicit qualitative and additional quantitative data (e.g. focus group testing and user surveys, respectively) to obtain nuanced and actionable feedback throughout the development process. It will be beneficial for me to continue learning ways to interact with users as well as save various iterations of this project.
