DH110: User Experience and Design
UX interface Design

## Brief Description of Project

The purpose this project is to assist users in the uniquely formidable process of accessing services and resources.

Background: The coronavirus pandemic and its impact on children and families is vast even if the longitudinal effects of such a traumatic experience during pivotal developmental periods is not yet known. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues and society faces challenges like never before, finding ways to support families in accessing health services for their children is more important than ever. There seems to be an unprecedented landscape of opportunities for technology to make an impact in the assessment, access to care, and digit resources. Digital health was already on the rise before the COVID-19 pandemic but has accelerated exponentially. While part of this has been a function of necessity, the other part stems from technology being able to make access to care more accessible than every before. This change has become an area of growing preference as well, as patients and providers have benefited from the convenience of telemedicine and the novel capabilities of the broader telehealth modality. 

Therefore, the purpose of this project is to support users in finding and accessing available resources in a clear and accessible manner for all users. This last point highlights the importance in taking breaking down each step of the interface design, as notably shown below.

## Screen Design

3. Provide the evidence of graphical user interface design variation (typography, shape, colors)

Typography

> Four fonts were trialed in this stage of development. The first font was the one provided, while the two following were the fonts "recommended" through google font searchs as "highly rated." Ultimately, I decided on a font that was similar to the original webpage and one that was clean, yet simple. 

Colors

> Utilizing Adobe software, I was able to extract the colors from the original logo. From there, I may some minor changes to the color scheme to allow for darker contrast in certain areas (especially important since I decided on a neutral light gray background to support users who may typically struggle with a stark white background). 

4. Description of your decision making process about the final graphical interface design

> While making decisions in this process, it was important to me to make the graphic design minimal and simplistic, therefore, aiming to only provide necessary information to. I designed the interface to be friendly, with bannered buttons and rounded edges, while keeping notable symbols (i.e., the navigation bar) in their original form to support universal understanding.

## Impression Test

This impression test was conducted with a **28 yo male** who works within computer science field. (_Unfortunately, this user did not consent to having their photo / screensharing recording shared. However, they did approve for me to transcribe and share their impressions._)

**Positive Remarks**
- "The colors seem to have coordination, I feel like red is pleasing to both men and women." 
- "Easy to read and follow along" 
- "Aesthetically pleasing website"
- "The arrows are helpful in order to follow along"

**Neutral Remarks**
- "Red is interesting choice, now that I think about it" 
- "Is it easy to get to this page? It doesn't seem like a homepage"

**Ways to Improve**
- "Are the extra search bars necessary? What do they search? Do you have to search or can you scroll and click?"
- "Why does it stop at 11 year olds?"
- "Is this all on the screen? Would you scroll to a second screen?" 

> Through this impression test,  I was really able to see how I could make this project my own moving forward and where it needed to go in order to easily communicate with the users. The user was overall very positive about the current iteration. He stated that it's interesting to choose red, since it is commonly more pleasing for men than women. He was stating how this could be important as he would imagine having to seek out resources or support as a father might be an intimidating task. This was a perspective I had not initially thought of as we know men are less likely to actively seek out resources or support unless it's imperative. 

## Accessibility (color-contrast) check

6. Evidence of accessibility (color-contrast at least) check

> I ensured that my color contrasts adhere to the WCAG2.0 AA level standard of accessibility, and decided on a non-white background to ensure that users with difficulty reading on a white background feel more comfortable using this site.

Dark Mode Option

## Reflection 

Moving forward, it's imperative to continue collecting elicit qualitative and additional quantitative data (e.g. focus group testing and user surveys, respectively) to obtain nuanced and actionable feedback throughout the development process. It will be beneficial for me to continue learning ways to interact with users as well as save various iterations of this project.
