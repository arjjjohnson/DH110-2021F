# An Innovative Approach to Interrupt the Services & Treatment Landscape: A new way to support and connect individuals, families and practitioners
## **Amanda Johnson** ~ _Psychologist, UX Researcher_

### Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic will long present as one of the bleakest times in American history reaching almost 400,000 deaths from the virus alone as we pass the year mark of the declaration of a global pandemic (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021). As the pandemic continues to pose extraordinary threats to human development and fundamental disruptions to healthcare services, understanding our role and the change we can bring as innovators and developers is more important than ever. The effects for children, especially those with healthcare needs have been even more stark, with this period resulting in lack of access to needed resources and support they would often receive. Therefore, the purpose of this project was to explore Arizona's Healthcare .gov webpages as a means to identify these potential gaps and barriers to accessing the care and support they may need.

### Design Statement 
Now more than every before, everyone is looking to connect with healthcare services. This project aims to connect three essential elements together 
- 1. The ability to access resources, support, and providers based on your interest and needs 
- 2. The ability to connect with provider DIRECTLY in your area (using geolocation) and 
- 3. The ability to communicate with these providers and support without having to set up numerous consultations and therefore, being effective and efficient support straight to your mobile device. 

### Competitor Analysis
The Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) is a state funded agency that provides health services to the State's population. The image below shows the homepage of the ADHS is dedicated to providing up to date information and resources to ensure the health and safety of the people of Arizona. With the current climate of the United States, this homepage focuses on the novel COVID-19 pandemic, and primarily focuses on access to resources and guidance related to the pandemic.

#### Heuristic Evaluation
> In order to evaluate the correct state of the AZ Department of Healthcare webpages, heuristic evaluations and usability testing were conducted. The intial heuristic evaluation highlighted that **overall,** at first glance the website appears functional and updated. There seems to be an overall color scheme, most of the text is readable, there appears to be search bars and a support system for direct feedback. However, upon further evaluation (or just moving the cursor ever so slightly), some problematic concerns arise. For example, in the full screen view of the homepage the toolbar disappears and the visual design are particularly concerning as they hinder the user's ability to navigate to any webpages beyond COVID-19 information.

#### Usability
> For this usability pilot test, I recruited a 27 year old female to navigate through various tasks using the Arizona Child & Teen healthcare pages. Although this participant does not have children of her own yet, I knew she would be an ideal candidate for this pilot as she would have an above average knowledge of various websites. Futhermore, throughout our introductions I learned that this participant works within Human Resources and focuses on resource access and data analytics, therefore, deeming her to be considered more of an expert than an average user. Based on my prior Heuristic Evaluation of this webpage, I thought it would be important to explore the navigation of the website as this was a main consider that was brought up. Specifically testing: visibility and system status, user control, consistency with standards.[>> Read more](https://github.com/arjjjohnson/DH110-2021F/blob/main/assignment02/README.md) 

### User Research
The purpose of UX storytelling is to consider the perspectives of the users to allow for an unbiased insight into the feature being explored. This process includes taking the user's perspective and understanding how they see the product and more importantly, how they would use it. Telling stories gives us a sense of culture, history, and personal identity. It allows us to come at problems from a place of empathy rather than only problem solving. This in turns allows us to create products specifically with the user in mind. [>> Read more](https://github.com/arjjjohnson/DH110-2021F/blob/main/assignment04/README.md)

For more insight into the specific needs of the users, I surveyed 51 users.  The purpose being to gain insight into context of parents and children, I wanted to reach as many individuals in the field as possible so I could see what there needs are. I understand, that this seems like a step back from watching individuals with various scenarios, but to reduce my own bias on the context, I needed to ask real people what was happening with their access to services, especially the key stakeholders: Parents, Educators, Practioners. Below is a sticky note representation of their top needs.

### UX Storytelling

From the field research gathered it seems that the solution is simple, first off, we know that families arenâ€™t happy with how they access care, we know that practitioners are looking for a way to integrate technology to ultimately ease some of their workloads, therefore, like i mentioned, the answer seems easy, create an application that expedites this process and allows families, individuals, practitioners the freedom to do it on their own time and focusing on their own needs.

To demonstrate the purpose of this proposed lo-fi prototype, I've created a storyboard from user feedback and how they might be facing these choices.

### Wireframe and Graphic Design Element Variation

While making decisions in this process, it was important to me to make the graphic design minimal and simplistic, therefore, aiming to only provide necessary information to. I designed the interface to be friendly, with bannered buttons and rounded edges, while keeping notable symbols (i.e., the navigation bar) in their original form to support universal understanding.

### Low-Fidelity Prototype

This process was a unique experience. As mentioned above, the pen and paper technique proved to be much more difficult than I originally expected. However, my participant was able to follow my conceptual process and was able to see the design ideas. They were impressed with how much can exactually be extracted from a small wireframe task. I wasn't expecting the user to have questions beyond the task stated and being curious what other buttons meant that they were not directly using. As such, I would definitely like to try my hand at digitizing this process in the future. Testing the prototype in its current form deemed to be a difficult task. There is a balance between including too much information where the user gets confused but also not including enough information then the user gets lost. Overall, I feel that creating digitized wireframes / wireflows would have allowed me to create and test more scenarios, situations, and steps more easily and may have provided a smoother experience for the test user. However, I feel that the testing that did occur was still beneficial for me because it highlighted the importance of small details for the user in deciding what to choose their actions and how they may or may not feel supported by the website they're using.

### High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype, assignment08)

The purpose of this project is to support users in finding and accessing available resources in a clear and accessible manner for all users. This prototypes aims to do just that -

### Evaluation and Revision History 

Impression Test
> Through the impression test, I was really able to see how I could make this project my own moving forward and where it needed to go in order to easily communicate with the users. The user was overall very positive about the current iteration. He stated that it's interesting to choose red, since it is commonly more pleasing for men than women. He was stating how this could be important as he would imagine having to seek out resources or support as a father might be an intimidating task. This was a perspective I had not initially thought of as we know men are less likely to actively seek out resources or support unless it's imperative.

Usability Testing
> Usability Testing was conducted at each round of decision making. Even now, I'm still finalizing the complete product to ensure I am adaquately capturing the users needs. The main functionality I chose to focus on was the menu and drop down pages -- after multiple rounds of user feedback etc. the issue that kept coming up was the navigation buttons and how to access the site from the page they were on. My users reported feeling that they were thrown into the website without making choices for themselves. 

Cognitive Walk-Through
> The cognitive walk-through highlighted some important key

Moving forward, it's imperative to continue collecting elicit qualitative and additional quantitative data (e.g. focus group testing and user surveys, respectively) to obtain nuanced and actionable feedback throughout the entire development process. It will be beneficial for me to continue learning ways to interact with users as well as save various iterations of this project.[>> Read more](https://github.com/arjjjohnson/DH110-2021F/blob/main/assignment07/README.md) 

### Conclusion

The coronavirus pandemic and its impact on children and families is vast even if the longitudinal effects of such a traumatic experience during pivotal developmental periods is not yet known. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues and society faces challenges like never before, finding ways to support families in accessing health services for their children is more important than ever. There seems to be an unprecedented landscape of opportunities for technology to make an impact in the assessment, access to care, and digit resources. Digital health was already on the rise before the COVID-19 pandemic but has accelerated exponentially. While part of this has been a function of necessity, the other part stems from technology being able to make access to care more accessible than every before. This change has become an area of growing preference as well, as patients and providers have benefited from the convenience of telemedicine and the novel capabilities of the broader telehealth modality.

One thing I learned with this project is that there is always more that you can edit and change, with the time limitations on assignments, I had to push myself to focus on select tasks rather than making a fully operational prototype. Additionally, I found that starting from scratch was almost easier than taking a constructed webpage and adding features.
