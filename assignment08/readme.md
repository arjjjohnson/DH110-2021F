# An Innovative Approach to Interrupt the Services & Treatment Landscape: A new way to support and connect individuals, families and practitioners (Evaluation of Arizona's Department of Health Webpages)
## **Amanda Johnson** ~ _Psychologist, UX Researcher_

### Introduction: a brief information about the project.
The COVID-19 pandemic will long present as one of the bleakest times in American history reaching almost 400,000 deaths from the virus alone as we pass the year mark of the declaration of a global pandemic (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021). As the pandemic continues to pose extraordinary threats to human development and fundamental disruptions to healthcare services, understanding our role and the change we can bring as innovators and developers is more important than ever. The effects for children, especially those with healthcare needs have been even more stark, with this period resulting in lack of access to needed resources and support they would often receive. Therefore, the purpose of this project was to explore Arizona's Healthcare .gov webpages as a means to identify these potential gaps and barriers to accessing the care and support they may need.

### Design statement: 
Now more than every before, everyone is looking to connect with healthcare services. This project aims to connect three essential elements together 1. The ability to access resources, support, and providers based on your interest and needs 2. The ability to connect with provider DIRECTLY in your area (using geolocation) and 3. The ability to communicate with these providers and support without having to set up numerous consultations and therefore, being effective and efficient support straight to your mobile device. 

### Competitor Analysis

The Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) is a state funded agency that provides health services to the State's population. The image below shows the homepage of the ADHS is dedicated to providing up to date information and resources to ensure the health and safety of the people of Arizona. With the current climate of the United States, this homepage focuses on the novel COVID-19 pandemic, and primarily focuses on access to resources and guidance related to the pandemic.

Heuristic Evaluation
> In order to evaluate the correct state of the AZ Department of Healthcare webpages, heuristic evaluations and usability testing were conducted. The intial heuristic evaluation highlighted that **overall,** at first glance the website appears functional and updated. There seems to be an overall color scheme, most of the text is readable, there appears to be search bars and a support system for direct feedback. However, upon further evaluation (or just moving the cursor ever so slightly), some problematic concerns arise. For example, in the full screen view of the homepage the toolbar disappears and the visual design are particularly concerning as they hinder the user's ability to navigate to any webpages beyond COVID-19 information.

Usability
> For this usability pilot test, I recruited a 27 year old female to navigate through various tasks using the Arizona Child & Teen healthcare pages. Although this participant does not have children of her own yet, I knew she would be an ideal candidate for this pilot as she would have an above average knowledge of various websites. Futhermore, throughout our introductions I learned that this participant works within Human Resources and focuses on resource access and data analytics, therefore, deeming her to be considered more of an expert than an average user. Based on my prior Heuristic Evaluation of this webpage, I thought it would be important to explore the navigation of the website as this was a main consider that was brought up. Specifically testing: visibility and system status, user control, consistency with standards.[>> Read more](https://github.com/arjjjohnson/DH110-2021F/blob/main/assignment02/README.md)
