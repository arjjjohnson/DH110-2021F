UX Storytelling

## The Purpose of UX Storytelling
* More background
* The purpose of UX storytelling is to shift your perspective to the user's perspective and see the world how they would see it.
* Creating personas and their story lets you and your team share the same image of the users.
* Storytelling also helps filter out any biases you or your interviewees had and focus solely on the users.

## Scenarios & Journey Map
> These scenarious are centered around Arizona's Government Webpage, specifically the children and adolescent resource pages.

### 1. John's Scenario & Journey Map
#### Why John is using this product
> John is having questions about his child's development. At a recent family barbeque, his sister asked him if he's concerned with his son's language development. With his sister being a pediatrician, he feels that she may be overanalyzing his son and snaps back. However, he can't help feeling a bit unsettled as he leaves the barbeque. He logs into Arizona's government page as his first step plan but instantly gets frustrated as there are hardly any resources available and they are not clearly marked. 

#### How John is using this product
> As product manager, John feels comfortable with techonology and typically experiences zero issues when it comes to finding an answer. He starts clicking around quite frequently and notices that he'll end up either pages back or be kicked off the webpage completely.

#### How Sarah is using this product
> Sarah feels fairly skilled in technology but as she tries to navigate the Arizona.gov homepage she is quickly
