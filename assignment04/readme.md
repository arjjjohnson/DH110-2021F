UX Storytelling

## The Purpose of UX Storytelling
* The purpose of UX storytelling is to consider the perspectives of the users to allow for an unbiased insight into the feature being explored. This process includes taking the user's perspective and understanding how they see the product and more importantly, how they would use it. Telling stories gives us a sense of culture, history, and personal identity. It allows us to come at problems from a place of empathy rather than only problem solving. This in turns allows us to create products specifically with the user in mind.

## Scenarios & Journey Map
> These scenarious are centered around Arizona's Government Webpage, specifically the children and adolescent resource pages. These are additional features to support or ways of bolstering existing systems. 

### 1. John's Scenario & Journey Map
#### Why John is using this product
> John is having questions about his child's development. At a recent family barbeque, his sister asked him if he's concerned with his son's language development. With his sister being a pediatrician, he feels that she may be overanalyzing his son and snaps back. However, he can't help feeling a bit unsettled as he leaves the barbeque. He logs into Arizona's government page as his first step plan but instantly gets frustrated as there are hardly any resources available and they are not clearly marked. 

#### How John is using this product
> As product manager, John feels comfortable with techonology and typically experiences zero issues when it comes to finding an answer. He starts clicking around quite frequently and notices that he'll end up either pages back or be kicked off the webpage completely.

### 2. Sarah's Scenario & Journey Map
#### Why Sarah is using this product
> When Evan was born, Sarah took a leave from her job as a registered nurse. She was anticipating going back when he turned 1-years-old but then her husband received a raise at work and with the high cost of childcare, it started to make more sense for her to stay home. 

#### How Sarah is using this product
> Sarah feels fairly skilled in technology but as she tries to navigate the Arizona.gov homepage she is quickly losing confidence.

## Reflection
In the end, this assignment took much more time than I was anticipating. I wanted to do each persona justice and really capture the stress and frustration that goes into this process and how poor technological support makes it seem almost impossible. With each of these personas, the need for support seems greater than ever. Instead of just trying to support individual people, I want to find ways to support from that system level and knowing how many more families you're helping simultaneously.
