DH110: User Experience and Design
UX Storytelling

## The Purpose of UX Storytelling
* The purpose of UX storytelling is to consider the perspectives of the users to allow for an unbiased insight into the feature being explored. This process includes taking the user's perspective and understanding how they see the product and more importantly, how they would use it. Telling stories gives us a sense of culture, history, and personal identity. It allows us to come at problems from a place of empathy rather than only problem solving. This in turns allows us to create products specifically with the user in mind.

## Scenarios & Journey Map
> These scenarious are centered around Arizona's Government Webpage, specifically the children and adolescent resource pages. These are additional features to support or ways of bolstering existing systems. 

### 1. John's Scenario & Journey Map
#### Why John is using this product
> John is having questions about his child's development. At a recent family barbeque, his sister asked him if he's concerned with his son's language development. With his sister being a pediatrician, he feels that she may be overanalyzing his son and snaps back. However, he can't help feeling a bit unsettled as he leaves the barbeque. He logs into Arizona's government page as his first step plan but instantly gets frustrated as there are hardly any resources available and they are not clearly marked. He doesn't exactly know what he's looking for, but he knows its not what is in front of him. He needs a clear way to search for his questions and be connected to practioners in the area that can clearly answer them. He is recommended an application that breaks down these questions using geolocation - this shows him what services are offered at various levels (individual, group, mentorship, support). 

#### How John is using this product
> As product manager, John feels comfortable with techonology and typically experiences zero issues when it comes to finding an answer. He starts clicking around quite frequently and notices that he'll end up either pages back or be kicked off the webpage completely. When he interacts with *The newly proposed design* he is able to systematically enter in details of importance and narrow his search to providers in the area who can explicitly help me. He seemlessly navigates the webpage and is feeling so much more supported than before.

### 2. Sarah's Scenario & Journey Map
#### Why Sarah is using this product
> When Evan was born, Sarah took a leave from her job as a registered nurse. She was anticipating going back when he turned 1-years-old but then her husband received a raise at work and with the high cost of childcare, it started to make more sense for her to stay home. Since she is stay-at-home mom she already wonders if Evan is missing out on potential socializability interactions but doesn't think much of it. She does however, start to notice some developmental markers he's not hitting and enters the Arizona Government webpage. She is instantly overwhelmed and thinks "Why isn't there a way to quickly connect with families around me who might be having these questions." After school she meets a new family who shows her a webppage that uses geolocation to connect families with one another. There are various levels of support integrated so she feels confident she's discussing with someone who is prioritizing her needs. 

#### How Sarah is using this product
> Sarah feels fairly skilled in technology but as she tries to navigate the Arizona.gov homepage she quickly loses confidence. With this *newly proposed design* Sarah is able to see families nearby who have asked the same questions and is able to view the community forum page to see how others went about solving this problem in her neighborhood, within the same school districts. She is joyful because for the first time she knows she can lean on her community during this difficult time.

## Reflection
In the end, this assignment took much more time than I was anticipating. I wanted to do each persona justice and really capture the stress and frustration that goes into this process and how poor technological support makes it seem almost impossible. With each of these personas, the need for support seems greater than ever. Instead of just trying to support individual people, I want to find ways to support from that system level and knowing how many more families you're helping simultaneously.
