UX Storytelling

## The Purpose of UX Storytelling
* The purpose of UX storytelling is to shift your perspective to the user's perspective and see the world how they would see it.
* Creating personas and their story lets you and your team share the same image of the users.
* Storytelling also helps filter out any biases you or your interviewees had and focus solely on the users.

## Scenarios & Journey Map

### 1. John's Scenario & Journey Map
#### Why John is using this product
> Mai currently volunteers at the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles while she takes a gap year before applying to medical school. She wants to become a pediatrician, so being able to connect to children and their parents is something she really values. Recently, a 12-year old patient she helps take care of asked Mai what books she recommends. Thus, Mai decided to explore children and young adult books she can recommend to patients. She wants to log books in a creative, journal-like way with colors and maybe even drawings, so her patients would also feel encouraged to log books and share them. However, she wants to be able to digitize her logs so more people can have access to them.

He spends most of his time thinking about how to facilitate a better contributor experience for his startup's product, while continuously talking to new and potential contributors for insights.
