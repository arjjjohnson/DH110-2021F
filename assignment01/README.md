# Access & Care: Addressing Health Disparities Through Functional and Accessible Webpages

The COVID-19 pandemic will long present as one of the bleakest times in American history reaching almost 400,000 deaths from the virus alone as we pass the year mark of the declaration of a global pandemic (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021). As the pandemic continues to pose extraordinary threats to human development and fundamental disruptions to healthcare services, understanding our role and the change we can bring as innovators and developers is more important than ever. The effects for children, especially those with healthcare needs have been even more stark, with this period resulting in lack of access to needed resources and support they would often receive. Therefore, I chose to explore the Arizona's Healthcare .gov webpages as a means to identify these potential gaps and barriers to accessing the care and support they may need.

### *Health and Wellness for All Arizonans* 

The Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) is a state funded agency that provides health services to the State's population. The image below shows the homepage of the ADHS is dedicated to providing up to date information and resources to ensure the health and safety of the people of Arizona. With the current climate of the United States, this homepage focuses on the novel COVID-19 pandemic, and primarily focuses on access to resources and guidance related to the pandemic.

Jakob Neilson's 10 Usability Heuristics Explained
| ------------------------|
| **1. Visibilty of System Status**: The design should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time. | 
| **2. Match between System & Real World**: The design should speak the users' language. Use words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal jargon. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order. |
| **3. User Control & Freedom**: Users often perform actions by mistake. They need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted action without having to go through an extended process.  | 
| **4. Consistency & Standards**: Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform and industry conventions.  | 
| **5. Error Prevention**: Good error messages are important, but the best designs carefully prevent problems from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions, or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.  | 
| **6. Recognition Rather than Recall**: Minimize the user's memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the interface to another. Information required to use the design (e.g. field labels or menu items) should be visible or easily retrievable when needed. |
| **7. Flexibility & Efficiency of Use**: Shortcuts — hidden from novice users — may speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the design can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.  | 
| **8. Aesthetic & Minimalist Design**: Interfaces should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in an interface competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility. | Good: xx <br /> Bad: xx | Improvement: xxxxx |
| **9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, & Recover from Errors**:Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no error codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution. |
| **10. Help & Documentation**: It’s best if the system doesn’t need any additional explanation. However, it may be necessary to provide documentation to help users understand how to complete their tasks.  |

### *Children Resources*

The Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) subsection, Children, focuses on providing parents with resources and information regarding their children. The ADHS states "protecting the health and wellbeing of your children and teaching them to be advocates of their health is one of the most important things you can do." Therefore, the purpose of this webpage is to empower parents to be the best resource and advocate for their children.
